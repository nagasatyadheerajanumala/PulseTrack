Great! ✅ Since your PulseTrack Status Page API is now working, here’s a complete checklist of APIs you should test across all key phases you’ve implemented:

⸻

🔐 1. Auth APIs

API	Method	Body/Param	Description
/api/auth/register	POST	{ email, password }	Register a new user
/api/auth/login	POST	{ email, password }	Logs in and returns a JWT


⸻

📡 2. Monitor APIs

API	Method	Header	Description
/api/monitors	POST	Authorization: Bearer <token>	Create a monitor
/api/monitors	GET	Authorization	Get all user monitors
/api/monitors/{id}/toggle	PUT	Authorization	Toggle monitor active/inactive


⸻

📈 3. Monitor Logs APIs

API	Method	Description
/api/monitors/{monitorId}/logs	GET	Fetch all logs for a monitor


⸻

🚨 4. Alerts APIs

API	Method	Description
/api/alerts?resolved=false	GET	Get unresolved alerts
/api/alerts?resolved=true	GET	Get resolved alerts
/api/alerts/{alertId}/resolve	PUT	Mark an alert as resolved


⸻

🟢 5. Status Page APIs

API	Method	Header	Description
/api/status-pages	POST	Authorization	Create a new status page with monitor IDs
/api/status-pages	GET	Authorization	Get list of your created status pages
/api/status-pages/public/{publicKey}	GET	(no auth)	Public endpoint to view status page with uptime, latency, logs


⸻

📧 6. Scheduled Checks
•	These run via Spring Scheduler every X seconds:
•	Logs monitor result
•	Saves MonitorLog
•	Sends alert & email/slack after retries fail
•	Respects alertFrequencyMinutes

✅ Test by:
•	Setting up a failing URL
•	Waiting until it logs and triggers alert
•	Confirm:
•	Log entry created
•	Alert created
•	Email sent
•	No duplicate email before alertFrequencyMinutes

⸻

✅ Final Checklist for Testing

Feature	Test
🔐 Auth Flow	Register → Login → Authenticated requests
🖥️ Monitor Creation	Add monitor with valid/failing URLs
📊 Logs	View logs for monitors
🚨 Alerts	Trigger alerts and test resolve
📄 Status Pages	Create and fetch public & private views
🔁 Retry Logic	Check retry logic before alerting
📧 Email	Confirm email delivery and delay logic
